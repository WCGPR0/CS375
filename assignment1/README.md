How to use this program
---------------------------------------------------------------
Please run this program with the following command line arguments:	victor_wu_C++.o -inputfile -outputfile

---------------------------------------------------------------
Tests
---------------------------------------------------------------
Please refer to inputFile.txt for sample inputs generated by random digits 0-100 from tester.py.

The tests done through tester.py is strictly black-box testing, but with the addition of four beginning of inputFile.txt are tests for common logic errors.
	-Empty line
	-Having 0
	-Having negative numbers
	-Having extremely large numbers

---------------------------------------------------------------
Code and Results
---------------------------------------------------------------
In my code, I use the algorithm of an insertion sort then a binary search for each value: element could be subtracted from another element within the same array.

Breaking it up, we can compute the time complexity as follows:
	Insertion has a worst-time complexity of O(n)
	Binary search has a worst-time complexity of O(log n)
	And we call Binary search n times by n times

This totals the time complexity of: n^2 + n + log n = O(n^2).

Notes
---------------------------------------------------------------
I wasn't sure what it meant by key - but how I interpreted this program is that if there exists any two elements in which the sum is also within the array, ouput it to a file.
